# Techdegree | Project 3 | Interactive Form



This project uses JavaScript to add customized and conditional behavior and interactivity to a registration form for a fictional Full Stack conference.
Beyond the standard usability metrics, this program offers advanced features such as preventing users from choosing events with conflicting scheduled times,
a keyup event listener that provides a real-time error message in the required credit-card field as well as a conditional message in the same field that changes 
depending on the the type of user error.
